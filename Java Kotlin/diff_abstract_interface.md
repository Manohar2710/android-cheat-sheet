- Abstract class :
	- An abstract class is an class that contains concrete and abstract methods(methods without implementation).

	- An abstract method must be implemented by the abstract class sub-class.

	- An abstract class cannot be instantiated, needs to be extended to be used

- interface : 
	- Interface is like a blueprint/contract of a class, like a class with method declaration but not implementation.

	- The implemented class provides the implementations for the declared methods in the interface.
