- var 
	- var is mutable, where its values can be changed in run time.

	- we can also make use of latinit to intialise the variable during run time.

- val 
	- val is immutable, where the variable declared with val needs to be declared only once, either at or diclaration ot run time.
	
	- we can make use of lazy keyword to initialize the val variables during there first time usage in any method or class. 

- const
	- its similar to val but the initialisation will happen at compile time. So variables declared with const key will be initialised during compilation
